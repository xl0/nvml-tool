# NVML Tool Build Script Improvements

## Plan
Improve the build scripts to correctly detect the location of the NVML library and its headers instead of hard-coding them.

## Todo Items
- [x] Examine current build scripts and identify hardcoded NVML paths
- [x] Research NVML library detection methods (pkg-config, find_library, etc.)
- [x] Implement dynamic NVML library detection in build scripts
- [x] Implement dynamic NVML header detection in build scripts
- [x] Test build script changes with different NVML installations
- [x] Add fallback paths for common NVML installation locations

## Review
Successfully improved the build system to dynamically detect NVML installation instead of using hardcoded paths.

### Changes Made:

1. **Makefile**: Replaced hardcoded paths with dynamic detection:
   - Added `NVML_HEADER_PATHS` and `NVML_LIB_PATHS` variables with comprehensive search paths
   - Implemented shell-based detection logic that searches multiple common locations
   - Added error checking to fail gracefully if NVML is not found
   - Added `show-nvml` target to display detected paths for debugging

2. **main.c**: Simplified header inclusion:
   - Changed `#include </usr/local/cuda-12.9/targets/x86_64-linux/include/nvml.h>` to `#include <nvml.h>`
   - Now relies on compiler include path from Makefile

### Search Paths Added:
**Headers**: `/usr/include`, `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/cuda*/targets/*/include`, `/usr/local/cuda/include`, `/opt/cuda/include`, `/opt/cuda/targets/*/include`

**Libraries**: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, `/usr/lib64`, `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/local/lib64`, `/usr/local/cuda*/targets/*/lib`, `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`, `/opt/cuda/lib64`, `/opt/cuda/targets/*/lib`

### Testing Results:
- Successfully builds using system-wide NVML installation (`/usr/include` and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`)
- Tool maintains full functionality with dynamic detection
- `make show-nvml` target provides visibility into detected paths
- Error handling prevents builds when NVML is not found

The build system now works across different NVML installation methods (system packages, CUDA toolkit, custom installations) without requiring manual path modifications.

## Update: Added pkg-config Support

### Additional Changes Made:

3. **Enhanced Makefile with pkg-config support**:
   - Added version-agnostic pkg-config detection (`nvidia-ml-*`)
   - Uses pkg-config as primary method when available
   - Automatic fallback to manual detection if pkg-config fails
   - Shows detection method in `make show-nvml` output

### Detection Priority:
1. **pkg-config** (preferred): Searches for any `nvidia-ml-*` package
2. **Manual detection** (fallback): Searches filesystem paths

### Testing Results:
- **With pkg-config**: Uses `nvidia-ml-12.9` package automatically
- **Without pkg-config**: Falls back to system-wide installation detection  
- Both methods build and run successfully

The enhanced build system provides robust NVML detection across all installation scenarios.

## Update: Added PREFIX Support for Installation

### Additional Changes Made:

4. **Added PREFIX variable for configurable installation**:
   - Added `PREFIX = /usr/local` variable (default value)
   - Updated `install` target to use `$(PREFIX)/bin`
   - Updated `uninstall` target to use `$(PREFIX)/bin`
   - Added directory creation with `install -d $(PREFIX)/bin`
   - Updated help text to document PREFIX usage

### Usage Examples:
```bash
make install                    # Install to /usr/local/bin (default)
make install PREFIX=/usr        # Install to /usr/bin
make install PREFIX=$HOME       # Install to $HOME/bin
make uninstall PREFIX=/usr      # Uninstall from /usr/bin
```

### Testing Results:
- Successfully installs to custom PREFIX locations
- Uninstall works correctly with custom PREFIX
- Installed binary functions properly from any location

The build system now follows standard GNU Makefile conventions for installation paths.

## Update: Simplified Build Fallback Logic

### Additional Changes Made:

5. **Simplified Makefile fallback mechanism**:
   - Removed complex manual detection logic with filesystem searching
   - When pkg-config fails, now prompts user to provide NVML_CFLAGS and NVML_LIBS
   - Added clear error messages with example usage
   - Updated help documentation to include NVML variable examples

### Simplified Detection Logic:
1. **pkg-config** (preferred): Searches for any `nvidia-ml-*` package
2. **User-provided** (fallback): User specifies NVML_CFLAGS and NVML_LIBS variables

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Automatic detection (preferred)
make

# Manual specification when pkg-config unavailable
make NVML_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/cuda/include" NVML_LIBS="-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lnvidia-ml"

# Custom CUDA installation
make NVML_CFLAGS="-I/opt/cuda/include" NVML_LIBS="-L/opt/cuda/lib64 -lnvidia-ml"
```

### Benefits:
- **Reduced complexity**: Removed ~20 lines of complex shell scripting
- **Clearer error messages**: Users know exactly what to provide when detection fails
- **Maintainability**: Much simpler logic to understand and debug
- **Flexibility**: Users can specify exact paths for custom installations

The build system is now more straightforward while maintaining full functionality across different NVML installation scenarios.

## Update: Project Structure Reorganization

### Additional Changes Made:

6. **Reorganized project directory structure**:
   - Moved source files to `src/` directory
   - Build output now goes to `build/` directory
   - Updated Makefile to handle new directory structure
   - Added automatic build directory creation
   - Updated clean target to remove entire build directory

### New Directory Structure:
```
nvml-tool/
├── src/
│   └── main.c          # Source files
├── build/
│   ├── main.o          # Object files
│   └── nvml-tool       # Executable
├── Makefile
├── CLAUDE.md
└── todo.md
```

### Makefile Improvements:
- Added `SRCDIR` and `BUILDDIR` variables for clean separation
- Build targets automatically create `build/` directory
- Object files use proper path transformation: `src/%.c → build/%.o`
- Clean target removes entire build directory: `rm -rf $(BUILDDIR)`
- Install target uses `$(BUILDDIR)/nvml-tool` as source

### Benefits:
- **Clean separation**: Source and build artifacts are separated
- **Standard layout**: Follows common C project conventions
- **Easy cleanup**: Single command removes all build artifacts
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more source files in `src/`
- **IDE-friendly**: Most IDEs recognize this structure pattern

The project now follows standard C project organization practices while maintaining all existing functionality.
